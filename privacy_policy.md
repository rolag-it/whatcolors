# Privacy policy

Dear WhatColors user,

Google tells me to inform you about privacy because WhatColors app asks permission to use Camera. 
Well, all taken shots are stored in a folder called "whatcolors" in your device. Nothing is shared by this app without your explicit control.

That's all folks!

Feel free to contact me for any further information.
